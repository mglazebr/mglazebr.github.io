We look at our body as a vessel to inspire other aspects of our lives and take this as an opportunity to remind ourselves that we are limitless! This class is not heated but definitely expect to sweat with intense body weight exercises. And don't you worry, there's always a low impact option! Water, towel & high fives are highly recommended!   </p>

                <h2> About Us</h2>
                    <p> Ground Up is a local coffee shop located in the heart of downtown San Luis Obispo. We were founded by two California Polytechnic State University Graduates, Morgan Glazebrook and Lindsay Hynes in February 2018. We took our love for branding and coffee and applied the skills we developed from our Graphic Communication ajor in order to create a chill, aestheic, and affordable coffee shop that students can study at all day. We wanted this to be an escape for people to get out of the house and do their daily work elsewhere by offering a plethora of seating choices, great lighting, tons of outlets and most importantly great coffee that will get you through all of your work. You'll leave our store feeling accomplished and refreshed if you're only here for 10 mintues or 5 hours! Come, relax, and stay a while. </p>
